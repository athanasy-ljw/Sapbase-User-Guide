# ðŸ˜„ SapBase (Sapinaceae Genomic DataBase)

## Why Sapbase?

<mark style="color:green;">**SapBase**</mark> aims to serve as a central genomic datahub and a powerful analytic platform for scientific research on Sapindaceae species and comparative studies with other plants.

Currently, SapBase hosts genomic resources for seven Sapindaceae species, including 16 full genome sequences, >400 sets of resequencing genomic data (4.82 TB), 919 RNAseq data (10.3 TB) from 49 projects, and 501 sRNA loci from the sRNAanno database. In total, there are 514,422 genes (893,747 transcripts), with 501,479 of them having functional annotations. 4,577 functional domains are annotated from 392,123 genes. SapBase also predicts 79,862,416 interaction relations between 145,248 proteins. 89,025 synteny blocks between every two Sapindaece species were identified covering 134,016 genes. Besides, 486 gene co-expression modules were singled out by the integrative analyses of these omics data.

SapBase is constructed and maintained by **XIALAB** from the College of Horticulture at South China Agricultural University.

Sapbase provides a large number of user-friendly and easy-to-use analysis tools for online analysis of massive omics data of Sapindaceae species. Here we provide detailed instructions for each tool, including an introduction to input files and output results. In fact, a link to the help documentation is provided on the page of each tool, and users can click directly to view it.
