# Genomes

Reference genomes of sapindaceae species and their GFF3 files are available here. In addition, we also provide corresponding CDS sequence, protein sequence and promoter sequence (CDS upstream 2000bp) for users to download and use.

In addition, if you only wants to download some gene sequences, it is recommended to use [**Bulk Sequence Fetch**](http://www.sapindaceae.com/bulk\_sequence\_fetch/bulk\_sequence\_fetch.html) function, which supports batch extraction of any gene sequences.
